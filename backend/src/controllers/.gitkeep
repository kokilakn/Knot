/**
 * Controllers Directory
 *
 * This directory contains request handlers that implement business logic.
 * Controllers should be organized by feature (e.g., photoController.js, faceController.js).
 *
 * Example structure:
 * - photoController.js - Photo upload, retrieval, deletion
 * - faceController.js - Face detection, tagging, search
 * - authController.js - Authentication and authorization
 *
 * Each controller should export functions that handle specific routes.
