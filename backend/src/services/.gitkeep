/**
 * Services Directory
 *
 * This directory contains business logic and external service integrations.
 * Services are shared utilities used by controllers.
 *
 * Planned services:
 * - faceRecognitionService.js - Integrate face detection/recognition API
 *   (e.g., AWS Rekognition, OpenCV, TensorFlow)
 * - photoService.js - Photo processing and storage
 * - databaseService.js - Database queries and management
 * - emailService.js - Email notifications
 *
 * Example usage:
 * const { detectFaces } = require('./faceRecognitionService');
 * const faces = await detectFaces(imageBuffer);
 *
 * Face Recognition Integration (FUTURE):
 * - This directory is prepared for plugging in face detection models
 * - Can support multiple providers:
 *   * AWS Rekognition
 *   * Google Cloud Vision
 *   * Microsoft Face API
 *   * OpenCV.js / TensorFlow.js
 *   * Local models (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
